===============================

The goal of this Frogger-style game is to get the character from the grass area at the bottom of the canvas to the water at the top of the canvas.

Sounds easy, but watch out for those pesky enemy bugs in the middle 3 rows of the canvas. They travel at varying speeds and if they touch your character he will be forced back to the original starting point.

Use that arrow keys to move the character up, down, left and right.

Once your character reaches the water he will be teleported back to the start position.

To play this game, clone the repo and open the index.html file.

Good luck!
